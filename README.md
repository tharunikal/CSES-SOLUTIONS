# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) implemented in Java. The solutions are categorized by topics for better organization and ease of navigation.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on the problem categories from the CSES Problem Set:

- **Introductory Problems**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Mathematics**
- **String Algorithms**
- **Additional Problems**

Each folder contains Java files corresponding to the solutions for problems in that category.
